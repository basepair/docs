# Getting started with Basepair

Basepair is an Enterprise genomics data analysis and interpretation platform. Many commonly used best-practices piplines are available. Users may add their own custom pipelines as well.

### Navigation
The menu bar at the top of the page allows you to quickly and easily browse your samples, analyses, and projects using the drop-downs.

### Example data
When you first log in to your dashboard, you’ll see two projects: **Project 1**, which is automatically created for you and where you can start uploading your samples; and **Example data**, which is where all the example data reports are stored.  

You can always access example reports by clicking the analyses. Keep in mind that the Example data project is view-only, so you cannot run your own analyses on this data. You’ll want to upload your own samples into Project 1 instead.


### Uploading Samples

You can click the **Upload** tab in the menu bar to upload your raw data, usually in the Fastq format. For Enterprise customers, many integrations are available including AWS S3, Illumina BaseSpace, FTP and NCBI’s GEO and SRA databases.

### Running Analyses

Once you have samples uploaded, you can start running analyses on your data by clicking the **Analysis** tab at the top, or clicking the **Run Analysis** button directly in your project.

### Pipeline Overview

If you’d like to see a more detailed overview of the analysis pipelines we have, click the **Pipelines** tab. Here you’ll find the pipelines, grouped by data type. Click on any individual pipeline to see the steps in the pipeline.
