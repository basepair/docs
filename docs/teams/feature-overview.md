Basepair users can establish teams through the Team feature to create and control their collaborating groups in the platform. The team feature provides teams a space to include projects alongside members and billing accounts to facilitate efficient department and user cross-team collaboration.

## Why is it needed?
The new feature introduced a structured team-based model, which took over the user-centric format that previously existed. The Team function establishes enhanced organisation alongside user permission control as well as cost management capabilities that multi-user facilities like laboratories and organizations need.The team-based organizational model helps Basepair better alignment between users, projects, and billing.

## Key Benefits for Customers
