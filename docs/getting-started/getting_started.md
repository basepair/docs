# Getting started with Basepair

Basepair provides a user-friendly suite of bioinformatics pipelines that allow for detailed analysis of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. Industry-standard, publicly available tools are streamlined to process raw FASTQ data from a variety of genomic assays including bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, WGS, WES/panel, ATAC-seq, CUT&RUN, CUT&TAG, ChIP-seq, metagenomics and more!

To log into your Basepair account, go to our login page [here](http://app.basepairtech.com/login) and type in your username and password.  

If you need to create a Basepair account, click the [Sign up](http://app.basepairtech.com/signup) button.

Basepair organizes your samples and analyses into projects, allowing you to create and edit projects as needed:

Opening a project makes it your current **_active project_**—this is where any new samples and analyses will be created.

Here, the **“RNA-seq”** project has been opened and summary statistics on both the samples and analyses are provided from the project dashboard:

The menu bar at the top of the page allows you to quickly and easily browse your samples, analyses, and projects using the drop-downs. When you first log in to your account, we automatically create your first project for you, called **“Project 1”**—feel free to change the name using the **Edit** button on the right side:

Once you have set up your project, the next step is to add samples to it.
