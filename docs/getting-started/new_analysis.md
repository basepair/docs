# How to Run a New Analysis on Basepair

To run a new analysis, make sure you have uploaded the samples you want to analyze. If you’re not sure how to do that, see our previous tutorial on how to add a sample to Basepair.

1. Hover over the **Analysis** tab at the top and click **New Analysis**.  
2. Choose the pipeline you want to run.  
3. Select the sample or samples you want to analyze.  
4. Feel free to change the analysis name as needed.  
5. *(Optional)* If you’re an advanced user and want to customize your analysis parameters, click **Change default options**.  
6. Finally, click **Run Analysis**.

The time it takes to run an analysis depends on the pipeline, ranging from about **30 minutes** for a differential expression analysis to a **few hours** for a single-cell RNA-seq analysis.

If you’re running multiple analyses at once, this won’t slow anything down—Basepair spins up servers on demand, so all analyses run in parallel.
