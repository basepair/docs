Basepair’s upload system is very easy to use.  

To add your data to Basepair, click **Upload**. Next, select your files. You will in most cases want to upload data files in **FASTQ** format. Generally, if you have single-end reads, you will have **1 file** and if you have paired-end reads, you will have **2 files**.  

Basepair does a good job of grouping your files based on whether your data is single- or paired-end, but you’ll want to double-check that your files have been grouped correctly, since naming conventions can vary.  

Next, you’ll want to add the appropriate metadata settings. Choose your **data type**, **genome**, and other optional fields such as spike-in or insert size.

- **Platform:** We support all major NGS platforms. If you are not sure, choose **Illumina**.  
- **Data type:** We support DNA-Seq, RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq and ATAC-Seq. If you have any other data type, please contact us.  
- **Genome:** We support many genomes! If your genome/assembly is not supported, please let us know and we will be happy to add it.  
- **Insert size:** The size of DNA fragment selected for sequencing. Usually required for ChIP-Seq analyses.  

The upload will start and you will see the progress bar directly on the page.  

Please leave the computer running while the uploads continue. Uploads are usually pretty fast, but can take longer if your internet connection is slow or if you have large files.  

Once your data has been uploaded, you’re ready to start analyzing it!
