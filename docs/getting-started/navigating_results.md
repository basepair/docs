When an analysis finishes running, you’ll receive an email notification that your report is ready. You can follow the link in the email to view the report, or navigate to it directly from your dashboard by clicking the relevant analysis.

Let’s take a look at an example differential expression report.

On the first page, you’ll find interactive graphs and figures. Hover over a figure to download it as a vector or PNG image, or click **Export to CSV** to download the data from tables.

Feel free to explore the report’s interactive features: adjust the *p*-value, search for a gene of interest in the table, or label a gene on the volcano plot. Other report types include additional interactive tools you can try.

If you’d like to perform further downstream analyses, additional files are available in the **Info** tab at the top of the report. Click any file to download it directly to your computer and continue exploring your results.
