# How To Share Data With Collaborators On Basepair



<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/32SPz-lNj7A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Sharing a sample with your collaborators and lab members is really easy. First, make sure the person you’re sharing with has a Basepair account. If they don’t, you can invite them through the **“refer a colleague”** link at the top of the page.

Next, find the project the sample is in and click on the sample line. This will take you to the list of samples in that project. Select the sample or samples, and click **Share**.

Enter the email of the user you want to share the data with, and assign them a permission level. You can give them **view-only**, **edit**, or **admin** access.

The user you’ve shared your samples with will receive an email notification and will be able to access the samples through their dashboard.

You can always change permission levels or remove a user’s access by clicking the **Manage** button next to each sample.
